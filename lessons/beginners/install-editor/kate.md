Line numbering
:   In the View menu, select Show Line Numbers.

Indentation
:   In the Settings menu, select Configure Kate.

    There in Editing select Indentation, and set there:

    * Default indentation mode: Python
    * Indent using: Spaces
    * Tab Width: 4 characters
    * Indentation width: 4 characters
    * Backspace key in leading blank space unindents

Syntax highlighting
:   works automatically, but the way of coloring is chosen based on the
    file extension - for example, `.py` for Python.

    Therefore, as soon as you create a new file in this editor, you should save it under the correct name as soon as possible.
