{% block setup %}

Indentation
:   In the Settings menu, choose Options, then Syntax,
    and then set "Tab Settings" to "Replace by Space".

The syntax highlighting will work automatically in files with the extension `.py` (like Python).
In other programming languages, indenting and syntax highlighting works differently.

Therefore, as soon as you create a new file in this editor, you should save it under the correct name as soon as possible.
