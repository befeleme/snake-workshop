# Installing Python

In this section, we will install Python.

That is done a little differently on every type of operating system. Choose a page according to your system:

* [Linux]({{ subpage_url('linux') }}) 
* [Windows]({{ subpage_url('windows') }}) 
* [macOS]({{ subpage_url('macos') }}) 

If you have a different system, or if you do not know the administrator password for your computer, please send us an email and we'll try to help.
