# Installing Python for macOS

Run the following command in the command line to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), a tool that simplifies the installation of applications and libraries that we will need for programming.

```console
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then install Python using the following command:

```console
$ brew install python3
``` 

Check that you have Python version 3.6 or higher.

```console
$ python3 --version
``` 


If "Python" and the version number appear (e.g. `Python 3.6.6`) and the version is 3.6 or higher, you have it installed.
Otherwise, something is wrong. Please send us an e-mail and we'll try to help.
